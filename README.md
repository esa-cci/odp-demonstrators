## Welcome to the Open Data Portal Demonstrators Repository

This is a place to store demonstration material for how to use the following services/APIs:

- CCI KE STAC Collections:
  - STAC Browser: Navigable representation of the CCI STAC/OpenEO Collection.
  - pystac client API: Programmatic access to all the latest versions of CCI datasets.
  - CEDA DataPoint: Additional notebooks on how to interface with CEDA's DataPoint module, to access cloud-optimised dataset products within the CCI STAC index (**Recommended!**)

- CCI OpenEO:
  - Local Processing: Currently a limited number of datasets are available through the CCI OpenEO STAC Collection, which can be accessed using OpenEO Local Processing. See the requirements files for python 3.10/3.11 to install a compatible environment and engage with the notebooks for how to access and analyse OpenEO-compliant CCI data.
